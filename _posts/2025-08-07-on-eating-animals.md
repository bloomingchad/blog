## harm reduction vs moral consistency: on eating animals

the core of it is simple: i know i’m hurting animals by eating them. but i'm still doing it. that feels inconsistent, and i’ve been trying to figure out if there's a way to think about it that makes sense.

#### the realization that started it

i was watching this SunnyV2-like video about "that vegan teacher". and looking at the comments, everyone was just dismissing her because her tactics are extreme. 
a bit too dismissive, if you will.

but it felt like people were using her as an excuse to dismiss the actual question she’s raising, which is a real one.

we are choosing to cause harm when we don't really have to.
i couldn't just dismiss it. i had to actually think it through.

#### trying to define the harm

my first thought was to figure out what the "harm" actually is. is it the pain, or is it the act of killing itself?

if it's just about pain, then maybe a perfect system with perfect anesthesia could solve it. it feels nothing at the end. problem solved?

maybe that isn't right. it feels like the life itself has value, not just the not having pain. 

really don't know.

#### the harm reduction insight

the insight came from a really simple example: an evening snack.

if i'm feeling hungry, i could grab some chicken nuggets or some potato chips. nutritionally, it's trivial. pleasure-wise, they're both just snacks. but the ethical cost is completely different. one involves the entire industrial process of raising and killing a sentient being. the other is just potatoes.

by choosing the chips, i'm not making some huge sacrifice. i'm not becoming "that guy" who complicates every social situation. i'm just making an easy swap in a low-stakes moment. but i've successfully eliminated 100% of the animal harm from that specific occasion.

this is quite practical, i said to myself.

#### applying the framework to other things

this "harm reduction" is quite reusable, and by focusing on the biggest, easiest wins, i saw it everywhere.

take global warming. a total ban on all fossil fuel vehicles right now isn't realistic. ambulances need to be fast, and critical logistics still need diesel. but does that mean we should do nothing? no.

this applies really well: we can push for massive changes where alternatives work well (like bringing back nuclear for electricity) and individuals can make big impacts on the easiest parts of their lives (like me biking to my office every day). we can still buy and keep a secondhand car for genuine needs, like a hospital emergency or getting kids to school when you're late.

you optimize where it's practical, and maintain flexibility for the hard parts.

#### but do it make me inconsistent?

i'm saying i know it's harmful, and i'm choosing to do the harmful thing sometimes, just less often. 

isn't that the definition of inconsistency? is that because its convenient?

my desire to cause less harm, and the practical/social reality of me being a human. this is something that i can actually sustain long-term. 

someone who tries to be a vegan for six months and then quits might cause more total harm over their lifetime than someone who reduces their consumption by 80% and sticks with it for 20 years.

#### concluding

i still devour meat and milk.
but i can chip in.

#### flaws

*   **the slippery slope.** "occasional" or "meaningful" use could easily expand over time until i'm back where i started.
