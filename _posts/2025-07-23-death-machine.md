so i'm calling my car the "death machine" now. not to be edgy or dramatic, 
but because that's literally what it is. and i think most people, including myself until recently, have forgotten this.

## the realization that hit me

i was sitting in class today thinking about my car parked outside. over 1000kg 
of steel and glass that i control with a few centimeters of range of my right foot.

then the question came, is vehicles the most lethal everyday weapon? that normal
citizens carry around?

it's not ant poison spray. it's not even kitchen knives. it's the thing we've 
completely normalized: cars.

think about the variables:
- **frequency of usage**: people drive multiple times daily.
- **proximity to the vulnerable**: we drive in shared spaces with cyclists, schoolchildren.
- **lethality without intent**: a moment of distraction, a medical episode, or a mechanical failure can kill. this is the major thing.
- **mass casualty potential**: the nice truck attack killed 86 people. one person, one vehicle.
- **the sheer power**: the amount of horsepower we have under the tip of our toes is insane.
- **careless people around you**: the culture that isnt really about safety.

with knifes you need close proximity, physical strength and actual direct
and sustained effort to cause harm. you have to actually really want to do it.

months of planning or hate or emotions that are misfed into something that causes
illegal behaviour.

even with guns you need accuracy; you have to aim, to pull a trigger,
to consciously direct the lethal force towards a target. 
most people dont have guns, mostly just yankees.

the death machine is different. it requires no accuracy, just momentum.
the destructive potential isn't tied to your skill or even your conscious will.
a medical episode, a moment of distraction, a simple mechanical failure—and the
intent is completely removed from the equation, but the massive lethality remains.

most car deaths aren't even intentional. they're just accidents.

## the math of normalized lethality

here, if i'm driving at 35km/h (a pretty normal city speed) and 
got unconcious, what happens? the death machine continues rolling.
at 35km/h, i'm covering about 10 meters per second. in a dense populated place 
like this, that's a zone with shops, pedestrians, motorcyclists.

my 1000kg+ vehicle becomes an unguided missile until it hits something substantial 
enough to stop it.

i thought my diesel car with its turbo lag might be less lethal.
the turbo that gets activated arounr 1700 rpm. i thought maybe that slow
initial power delivery provides a safety buffer. but the physics reality is harsh:
even at low rpm, the lethality comes from mass × velocity, not engine power.

## the speed limit

following the speed limit isn't really about the law anymore.
it's about what level of self awareness you have. it's about how much killing
power you're willing to wield around other humans.

- a **30 km/h** zone isn't "slow driving" — it's **"non-fatal to pedestrians" speed**.
- a **60 km/h** road isn't "normal driving" — it's **"likely fatal if you hit someone" speed**.
- a **100 km/h** highway isn't "fast driving" — it's **"instantly lethal if anything goes wrong" speed**.

every km/h over the limit is a conscious decision to increase your killing potential.
most people think they're just "driving to the store." i now realize i'm controlling 
lethal force and choosing how dangerous to be to everyone around me.

it's simultaneously enlightening and terrifying.

## the complacency problem

here's what scares me: i know i'll become one of the complacent
expeicned drivers. it's basically inevitable. familiarity breeds carelessness.
that sharp awareness i have now will fade as the death mahcine starts feeling "normal."

so calling it the "death machine" is my psychological hack. my reminder. every time i say 
"taking the death mahcine to college" or "the death mahcine needs fuel," i'm 
forcing myself to remember what i'm actually operating.

it's like creating my own mandatory safety warning system.

## motorcycles: disproportionate harm shift

my dad waited until now to give me car access, and i totally agree with him on this delayaling. 
his logic was sound—motorcycles at 19 are dangerous for the rider. he says that atleast when we crash
we will be in the chassis rather than shoting over.

but here's the insight he doenst cobsider: the shift in responsibility.
- **motorcycle**: mainly a "don't kill yourself" mission. there is a inherent sense of fear.
- **death mahcine**: now it's "don't kill others." i have dispropotionate harm towards killing others.

the lethality i can inflict on others just increased exponentially. my capacity 
for unintended mass casualties went way up.

## the germany incentive & the daily test

i will want to leave india and go to gemrmany, so i have an incentive to not do any felonies.
this makes for a long-term constraint on risky behavior. local recklessness becomes
much more expensive.

my daily journey from college to home and vice versa is only 5 kms, but through dense populated places.
it's like 20-30 mins of low-medium risk drving (overtaking but not too much risky). but that's still
20-30 minutes of managing lethal potential. every single day, 2 times a day, in india.

will the germany goal keep me conservative? i hope it does. but honestly, i'm 
not certain. psychology changes, circumstances change, time pressures emerge. 
hoping for good judgment isn't the same as guaranteeing it.

## an RFC: mandatory vehicle lethality warnings

this is a wild idea. i have an rfc, when we enter the car, the car must have a warning about these
things. and only then should it start. a prompt that forces a moment of conscious awareness.

the challenge is emergency situations that are critical to those few seconds. 
maybe smart bypass systems could work:
- an emergency override button with a voice command.
- context-aware system (like a GPS detecting hospital proximity).
- a tiered system: full warning on the first start of the day, shorter one after.

the goal isn't to inconvenience people, but to break the complacency cycle.

huh, people endanger their own lives, to try to look cool. you are saying to
me that, people have to start caring about themselves first, then the people
that are riding with them, and then the people around them? really?

## concluding

i'm getting the death mahcine because my parents are busy, and its
supposed to make me more mature of a person.
all i see is excitement creeping and responsibility.

looking at this substantial machine, i feel like i have a lot of power,
something that is really sorry too much for my age. not that im reckless or speeding
a lot. that teenag-ish thing is gone, and i dont really have a lot of friends to
show off to too. 

what remains is this weight of responsibility.

calling it the "death machine" isn't pessimistic. i hope its a psychological device.
the moment we forget what we're actually doing is the moment we become
dangerous to everyone around us. we low chance the meaning changes to something else
as i get older.

and maybe that's the real test of maturity: not the excitement about having power, 
but the genuine, unsettling awareness of the responsibility that comes with it.
