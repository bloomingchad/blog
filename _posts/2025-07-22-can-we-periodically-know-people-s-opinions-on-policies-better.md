> im just 19 and from India, learning german for 5 weeks, i can't
really speak for germany, but what i do know that i have pieced together,
and even if the specifics are inaccurate, the post will try to suggest a
more modern and democratic concept.
{: .prompt-warning }

the collapse of Bundeskanzler Scholz's government in November 2024 was a political earthquake.
but what i found most fascinating was the role of the Free Democratic Party (FDP).
after years of Merkel's famous talent for compromise keeping coalitions together,
this one just shattered.

the FDP triggered the crisis over the "debt brake" policy, positioning themselves as
principled fiscal hawks. it was a high-stakes, high-profile stand. the result? in the
february 2025 snap election, they were annihilated. they secured just 4.3% of the vote,
falling below the 5% threshold and getting wiped out of the bundestag entirely.

hoho, hold on mister, there was also the D-Day memo thing that contributed.

how could a party's leadership be so profoundly disconnected from the will of its
own voters that it would choose a path leading to its own destruction?

how can a MdB know what the people it represents thinks about a situation?

but i would try to be empathetic and try to say that, yes, people do diverge over time.
they represent people but can get more disconnected over time.

## phase 1: the obvious, party-internal fix

my first thought, which i explored in a long back-and-forth with Claude, was to fix the
problem from within the party structure itself. it seemed logical. if the FDP leadership
didn't know what their members wanted, then we should *make* them ask.

the idea started to take shape: a mandatory, state-funded "internal party consultation."
this wouldn't be a suggestion; it would be a legal requirement. every few months, or maybe
just when there is a serious matter that needs polling, parties would have to poll their
registered members on key policy stances using simple tools, maybe even just checkboxes
on major issues, through their apps even.

this would create a permanent, formal check on elite decision-making. no longer could
a leader like christian lindner *assume* he had the backing of his base for a high-stakes
gamble; he'd have the data to prove it or disprove it. it felt like a clean, direct
solution to force parties to stay in sync with their own grassroots.

## phase 2: realizing the system could be gamed

after developing this initial idea, i hit a wall. i started imagining how it would
actually work in practice. what happens with a controversial policy topic? the party
leadership still holds all the cards. they could easily, and probably would, game the
system.

Claude and i discussed this specific flaw. a party wanting to justify more spending
wouldn't ask a neutral question like, 

> "should we raise taxes?" 

of course not. they'd frame it as, 

> "should we support vital infrastructure investment for germany's future?".

the results would be completely skewed, and the leadership could then point to their
manipulated poll and say, "see? the members agree with us!" they could cherry-pick who
they polled, when they polled them, and how the questions were worded.

the system designed to break the elite bubble would just become another tool for
reinforcing it. the problem was that i was trusting the fox to honestly report on the
state of the henhouse. it was a fatal flaw that would render the entire exercise
pointless. the internal-only approach was a dead end.

## phase 3: the leap to a truly non-partisan solution

this realization was the turning point in the whole thought process. the solution
couldn't involve trusting the political parties at all. the system had to be completely
independent.

this is where the concept evolved into something much bigger: a national citizen
consultation system.

instead of a party-internal process, this would be a national institution, run by an
independent body with the same authority and impartiality as the federal election
commissioner. 

this would be like the federal constitutional court, appointed by different members.
i would leave this as an exercise for the reader.

crucially, and this was the big leap, it wouldn't just be for the ~1.5% of
germans who are registered party members. it would be open to **all interested
citizens**. this would finally give a real voice to the silent, non-partisan majority and
provide a much more accurate picture of the national mood on any given issue.

and to solve the manipulation problem for good, the system would require a strict
**dual-question methodology**. for every major policy, the independent body would design
two questions—one framed favorably, one unfavorably—to get a true, unbiased reading of
public sentiment. the transparency of this process, with all results and methodologies
published openly, would make it nearly impossible for anyone to spin the data.

but yes, great power rests in the people who write the multiple questions that get put
down to the normal citizens who find time to mark their preferences.

but we could actually make it be written in a more all sides approach, 
something like this
> Q) Should we restart immigration?
>  -> helps poor people that face dangerous lives get safe home.
>  -> (a middle question)
>  -> this will drive up the burden and strain an people even more

or anything better please.

## phase 4: answering the practical questions and seeing the bigger picture

naturally, practical questions came up. "won't this cost more to the already strained taxation
citizen?" after thinking it through, the answer was a clear no. the cost, when absorbed
into existing budgets for democratic institutions and public media, would amount to mere
cents per citizen per month. 

even else, consider the immense economic and social cost of a government collapsing or
even misrepresenting the people, from which all poweer emanates from,
it's a tiny price to pay for a massive increase in democratic responsiveness and
stability.

## concluding

this system wouldn't replace representative democracy. it's not about
governance-by-referendum. or something as luxorious as Switzerland, 
it would enhance it. it gives politicians what they currently
lack: a reliable, real-time signal of public will between elections.

growing up as a young adult, i realized that people arent really one-dimensionally classifiable 
into the left or the right, every citizen has a different opinion on individual topics, different experiences, different life, giving each of them a official polling would be a way to better, and 
officially know what the people really think.

and they should even be given the priviledge to have a decimal slider instead of a hardline
yes or no. criminal, that.

it creates a powerful form of self-enforcing accountability. a party that consistently
ignores the clearly expressed preferences of the public in these consultations would be
forced to defend that position in the media and, ultimately, at the ballot box. the
opposition would have a field day with the data.

they have no reason to ignore the will of the people. and they have the choice to actually
feel like they exist and are participating in the government, which you dont get when you
are from a country that is one in 1400 million population.

and no it won't cause voter fatigue, people dont have to do it if they dont want to.
this is about a (3 month) poll on various policies and general policy questions.
and the database is shown, for everybdoy to know, what this is.

and even if the right uses it to encourage more youngsters to answer those polls to skew the data.
that will force the left people to participate, and balance this.

democracy becomes beyond a simple "vote every four years" to one with
a continuous, structured, and transparent feedback loop between the people and their
representatives.

even if it isn't, this suggestion aims to treat the underlying disease of a potential
elite disconnect.


## flaws

this could actually go tits up:

### 1) you expect middle ground people to vote
  to find time in their daily lives, to open a app,
  and to fill out a long text wall above a policy, its like youtube likes and dislikes.

  people dont like a video beacuse its good, they like it beacuse its great, 
  thus those two buttons are the extreme reactions, and you see that high for a shitty apology video.

  this will become a platform for extreme peoples. thats bad.
    
### shuffle the cards:
  - run huge democratic feel-good masturbatory campaign.
  - make all citizens register, probably mostly younger.
  - use official mail, "citizen you have been selected for this quarter policy opinion polling",
    like a jury summon 
  - from a subset random selection of those registered people are invited to participate.

   this is still a subset, it doesnt really solve the problem.
  
### give them candies:
  - €20 vouchers
  - free tea coffee cookies
  - admission to a lottery.

### make them cooperate
  - split each to 50 people groups. 
  - make them do some form of social work together. like picking trash or cleaning.
  - make them normalize? and then the extreme emotions hopefully calm down
  - they will get time to know each other more?
  - *bad thing*:
      - could work the other way, the charismatic person, if extremist, polarize others.

> this is a draft capturing my thought process. it started as a narrow fix and evolved.
probably many practical details to figure out, but the core concept feels stronger and
more robust than where i began.
